# Artist Statement

My artwork explores a mixologistâ€™s workstation, set in a high end bar on a snowy night. The piece seeks to immerse viewers in a cozy and warming atmosphere, providing a sense of escape and tranquility. By contrasting gentle snowfall with warm lighting, the artwork depicts a relaxing space, offering viewers a momentary retreat from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.

The piece features a variety of interactive elements, allowing viewers to craft their drink of choice and encouraging them to experiment with different color combinations and ingredients. This interactive process is designed to be rewarding, offering a personalised experience that gratifies the viewer as they see the direct impact of their choices coming to life. The act of creating a drink becomes a contemplative journey, where each decision feels meaningful, contributing to a final goal. 

Through this, my work aims to invite viewers to take a step back and intentionally consider their actions. I hope that, in doing so, viewers are inspired to reflect on the spaces we inhabit and how the choices we make within them can shape our individual experiences and emotions.
