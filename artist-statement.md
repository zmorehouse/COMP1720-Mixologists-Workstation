# Artist Statement

My artwork explores a mixologistâ€™s workstation. Set in a high end bar on a snowy night, the piece seeks to immerse viewers in a cozy and warming atmosphere, providing a sense of escape and tranquility. By contrasting the gentle snowfall with warm lighting, the artwork depicts a relaxing space, offering viewers a momentary retreat from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.

The piece features a variety of interactive elements, allowing viewers to craft their drink of choice and encouraging them to experiment with different color combinations and ingredients. In doing so, my work aims to offer a rewarding, personalised experience that invites viewers to take a step back and intentionally consider their actions. Through this, I hope my artwork can inspire viewers to reflect on the spaces we inhabit and how the choices we make within them can shape our personal perceptions and perspectives. 

Ultimately, the piece serves as a meditation on the art of creation. It does not exist simply to help individuals appreciate the nuances of bartending, but also to encourage viewers to savor the process just as much as the final outcome.
