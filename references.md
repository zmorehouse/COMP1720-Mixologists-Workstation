## Artwork Inspiration
There were a number of interactive games and spaces that inspired my creations. Notably, the Club Penguin Cafe and Bartender:The Right Mix both helped to inform my key premise and the layout of the workstation. These works, alongside Van Gogh’s ‘Cafe Terrace at Night’, also provided points of reference for the ambience and style of the scene.
