# Mixologists Workstation

Mixologists Workstation is an interactive artwork created in p5.js

## Artists Statement

My artwork explores a mixologist’s workstation, set in a high end bar on a snowy night. The piece seeks to immerse viewers in a cozy and warming atmosphere, providing a sense of escape and tranquility. By contrasting gentle snowfall with warm lighting, the artwork depicts a relaxing space, offering viewers a momentary retreat from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.

The piece features a variety of interactive elements, allowing viewers to craft their drink of choice and encouraging them to experiment with different color combinations and ingredients. This interactive process is designed to be rewarding, offering a personalised experience that gratifies the viewer as they see the direct impact of their choices coming to life. The act of creating a drink becomes a contemplative journey, where each decision feels meaningful, contributing to a final goal.

Through this, my work aims to invite viewers to take a step back and intentionally consider their actions. I hope that, in doing so, viewers are inspired to reflect on the spaces we inhabit and how the choices we make within them can shape our individual experiences and emotions.

### Artwork Inspiration
There were a number of interactive games and spaces that inspired my artwork. Notably, the Club Penguin Cafe and Bartender:The Right Mix both helped to inform my key premise and the layout of the workstation. These works, alongside Van Gogh’s ‘Cafe Terrace at Night’, also provided points of reference for the ambience and style of the scene.
