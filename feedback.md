This bar is awesome! You've really nailed the high-end, cosy atmosphere with your aestheticâ€”it feels immersive and well thought out.

I love how mixing different liqueurs results in various "cocktails," but it would have been even more engaging if there was a visual representation for each unique drink. The outcome of "Enjoy your drink" is a nice touch, but adding variety and visuals after creating a drink would enhance the experience and make it feel more dynamic.

Program Design: The interactions work smoothly, and the animations flow well with the design. Overall, you've created a polished and functional piece that only needs a few tweaks for added depth. Great job!
